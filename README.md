## Instructions
Note that you must compile your readme (this document) for it to properly display as part of your github repository. 

Once you have received feedback on your project proposal (via Canvas) you may alter this README so that it describes your final project instead of the project proposal. 

## Data Set
Provide a link to your dataset here, and a description of the variables in the data set.

## Potential Topics to Explore Using the Data Set
Describe avenues you might explore using the data. What are your goals? How do you plan to explore the data? You can provide some exploratory plots here if you have them available, otherwise, list what types of things you will be looking for.
